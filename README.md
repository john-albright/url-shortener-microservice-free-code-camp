# Free Code Camp: APIs and Microservices Project 3/5
## [Request Header Parser Microservice](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/apis-and-microservices/apis-and-microservices-projects/url-shortener-microservice)

This project is the third of five projects to be completed for FreeCodeCamp's fifth of six JavaScript certificate: [APIs and Microservices](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/apis-and-microservices#apis-and-microservices-projects). The API uses a form on the index page to store websites as shortened URLs. It does so by assigning a number to the website after being submitted to the form. The website can then be accessed via the /api/shorturl/ subdirectory followed by the shortened url (number) assigned to that website. The url, short url number, and date/time of creation were all saved in a Mongo database using Atlas. To extend the assignment, I allowed the user to be able to see all the short url codes at the /api/shorturl/ subdirectory.
