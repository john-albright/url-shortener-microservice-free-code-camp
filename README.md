# Free Code Camp: Back End Development and APIs Project 3/5
## [URL Shortener Microservice](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/back-end-development-and-apis/back-end-development-and-apis-projects/url-shortener-microservice)

This project is the third of five projects to be completed for FreeCodeCamp's fifth of six JavaScript certificate: [Back End Development and APIs](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/back-end-development-and-apis/#back-end-development-and-apis-projects). The API uses a form on the index page to store websites as shortened URLs. It does so by assigning a number to the website after being submitted to the form. The website can then be accessed via the /api/shorturl/ subdirectory followed by the shortened url (number) assigned to that website. The url, short url number, and date/time of creation were all saved in a Mongo database using Atlas. To extend the assignment, I allowed the user to be able to see all the short url codes at the /api/shorturl/ subdirectory and created a table to be populated with all the websites and short url codes stored in a Mongoose Atlas database.
